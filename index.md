about
=====
I am a senior software engineer at [HarQen][harqen]. We do
interesting things with voice.  Our focus is on adding value to conversations
through time shifting and attaching metadata.

When I am not working, I enjoy spending time with my beautiful wife; staying
active through running, biking, and sports; hacking personal projects; and
trying to keep my backlog of unread articles reasonable.

For a little more detail, check out my [resume][resume]. Among other ways I can
be reached via [jesse.vogt@gmail.com][email] or [@jesse_vogt][twitter].

projects
========
Sometimes coding at work is just not enough. These are a few
of my more recent or notable projects:

[![Nodal][image_nodal]][nodal]
[Nodal][nodal] is a social network visualizer initially built for an [Oracle
hackathon][oracle_hackathon] by [Matt Stockton][matt], [Kris
G&ouml;sser][kris], and myself. We recently updated it to use the GitHub social
network. We built it with [D3.js][d3] and [Flask][flask].

[![Dayda][image_dayda]][dayda]
[Dayda][dayda] is a "thing" tracking webapp. I personally use it for tracking
time (coding and reading) and miles run. The data can be visualized as bar and
line graphs or as a [Seinfeld Calendar][seinfeld_calendar]. I worked on Dayda
with [Kris G&ouml;sser][kris] and [Matt Stockton][matt]. We built it with
[D3.js][d3] and [Django][django].
{: .project }

[![Automated Foosball Table][image_aft]][aft]
The [Automated Foosball Table][aft] was my senior design project at at
[MSOE][msoe]. I worked on it with Jamie Kirkpatrick, Kyle Sweet, Andrew Gerke,
and Gordon Johnson. We took a normal foosball table, added motors, lasers, and
a computer and created a machine capable of beating humans. I was responsible
for the majority of the software. I built the motor control, sensor reader, and
game logic as a kernel module running under [RTLinux][rtlinux]. I used
[SDL][sdl] to create an interface to control certain aspects of the system and
data visualization.
